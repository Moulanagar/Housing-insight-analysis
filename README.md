# Housing-insight-analysis
Prof. Buddhanand Banerjee

**Objective**:<br> Utilize advanced regression techniques and time series modeling to analyze socio-economic factors affecting housing prices.</br>
**Dataset Source**:<br>Boston Housing Dataset </br> 
**Description**: <br>The dataset includes various socio-economic metrics such as crime rate, property tax rates, and student-teacher ratios, which impact housing prices.</br>
**Methodology**<br></br>
**Data Preprocessing**: <br> Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis. </br>
**Regression Analysis**:  <br>Conducted multiple linear regression to model the relationship between independent variables and housing prices. </br>
**Time Series Modeling**: <br> Applied time series analysis to understand trends and patterns over time. </br>
**Model Validation**: <br> </br>
         **ANOVA Tests**: F-statistic of 30.5 and p-value < 0.001.
         **Multicollinearity Analysis**: Verified all Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) were less than 5.
**Results** <br> </br>
**Model Performance**:  <br> Achieved an R-squared value of **0.74**and an adjusted R-squared value of **0.99**. </br>
**Cross-Validation**: Ensured high predictive accuracy with minimal difference between ordinary and PRESS residuals.
