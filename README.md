# Housing-insight-analysis
Prof. Buddhanand Banerjee

**Objective**:<br> Utilize advanced regression techniques and time series modeling to analyze socio-economic factors affecting housing prices.</br>
**Dataset Source**:<br>Boston Housing Dataset </br> 
**Description**: The dataset includes various socio-economic metrics such as crime rate, property tax rates, and student-teacher ratios, which impact housing prices.
Methodology
**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
**Regression Analysis**: Conducted multiple linear regression to model the relationship between independent variables and housing prices.
**Time Series Modeling**: Applied time series analysis to understand trends and patterns over time.
**Model Validation**:
         **ANOVA Tests**: F-statistic of 30.5 and p-value < 0.001.
         **Multicollinearity Analysis**: Verified all Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) were less than 5.
**Results**
**Model Performance**: Achieved an R-squared value of **0.74**and an adjusted R-squared value of **0.99**.
**Cross-Validation**: Ensured high predictive accuracy with minimal difference between ordinary and PRESS residuals.
Tools and Technologies
         **Programming Language**: Python
         **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib
